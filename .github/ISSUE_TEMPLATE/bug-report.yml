        What version of Get5 are you using? Use [`get5_status`](https://splewis.github.io/get5/latest/commands/#get5_status) in your server console to print it. Note that we only provide support for official builds, so if you compiled Get5 yourself, please run an official build and verify that you still have the problem. You may also download a nightly/prerelease build and verify that you still have the bug then. You can download the latest versions [here](https://github.com/splewis/get5/releases).
