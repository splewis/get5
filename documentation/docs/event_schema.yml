  description: |
    This is the documentation of all JSON events and native plugin forwards for Get5. All HTTP events get
    sent as POST requests to the root of the URL you provided for
    [`get5_remote_log_url`](configuration#get5_remote_log_url) in your Get5 configuration. You should inspect the value
    of the `event` property to determine the type of event. You cannot select which events to receive, but you can
    instead discard the ones you don't need.
    
    You are expected to return a 200-range HTTP code to all request, or Get5 will consider them failed. The HTTP timeout
    is 15 seconds and there are no automatic retries.

        Called when **any event** is fired. This forward takes two parameters (while all others take only one); the
        event object itself *and* a string representing the encoded JSON object. If you use this forward, you should
        fetch the event name and switch on it, casting the object to its correct subclass using
        `view_as<TheEventSubclass>(event)`.
