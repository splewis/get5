        Called when **any event** is fired. This forward takes two parameters (while all others take only one); the
        event object itself *and* a string representing the encoded JSON object. If you use this forward, you should
        fetch the event name and switch on it, casting the object to its correct subclass using
        `view_as<TheEventSubclass>(event)`.
