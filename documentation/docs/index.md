# Welcome to Get5 Documentation

The aim for this documentation is to provide a full overview of what is included in the Get5 plugin. Originally based off of [pugsetup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup) and inspired by [eBot](https://github.com/deStrO/eBot-CSGO), it intends to be as non-invasive and builds most of its functionality on top of the CS:GO server operations. It is meant to be an easy-to-use solution for tournament and LANs. Use the sidebar to navigate around the documentation. If you are installing this on your game server, head over to the [Installation](./installation.md) instructions.
