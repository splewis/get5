# Download and Installation
You must have [Sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net/) downloaded and installed on your server. Please note that get5 only supports Sourcemod version 1.9 and above. Instructions of how to install Sourcemod and Metamod (requirement of Sourcemod) can be found on their website.

## Download Get5
Releases of Get5 can be found in the [Tags](https://github.com/splewis/get5/tags) section of the repo. These versions are known to be stable, but may be lacking features that are currently in development. If you would like to test new features, or be on the "bleeding edge", you can also download through the Jenkins instance found [here](https://ci.splewis.net/job/get5/), or the build artifacts found under each run in GitHub actions [here](https://github.com/splewis/get5/actions).

## Installation
Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract it into your `csgo/` directory in your game server. If all goes well, you should have the compiled plugin located at `addons/sourcemod/plugins/get5.smx`. Once the plugin first loads on the server, you can edit general get5 cvars in the autogenerated `cfg/sourcemod/get5.cfg`. You should also have 3 config files: `cfg/get5/warmupcfg`, `cfg/get5/knife.cfg`, cfg/get5/live.cfg. These can be edited, but I recommend not blindly pasting another config in (e.g. ESL, CEVO). Configs that execute warmup commands (mp_warmup_end, for example) **will** cause problems.

### Installing Steamworks (Optional)
SteamWorks is not required for Get5 to work on your game server, however it is required if you wish to load match configs remotely. You can download the latest binaries for SteamWorks [here](https://github.com/KyleSanderson/SteamWorks/releases/). If you require a Windows build of the extension, that can also be found [here](https://github.com/hexa-core-eu/SteamWorks/releases) instead. After downloading, unzip the file and merge the `addons` directory to the one in your CS:GO server installation.

### Installing get5_apistats (Optional)
If you want to use the [get5 web panel](https://github.com/splewis/get5-web) (however, this is unsupported, and there are other tools/webpanels available) to manage matches and display stats, then you should install the get5_apistats plugin in addition to the get5 plugin. In addition to get5.smx in `addons/sourcemod/plugins`, you should have copied get5_apistats.smx into that directory as well. Both plugins are included in releases/builds, and the apistats plugin will be in the `disabled` folder.

Note: this requires that you installed the SteamWorks extension from the above step. The command get5_web_avaliable will tell you if this plugin was successfully installed. If not, it will reply with "unknown command".

Congratulations, get5 is now installed on your server, and you can continue to [Configuration](./match_configuration.md).
